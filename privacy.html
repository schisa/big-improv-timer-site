        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Big Improv Timer is a simple rehearsal timer for improv performers. The app is designed to
          collect as little information as possible. There are no user accounts and no in-app social
          features.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Big Improv Timer does not ask you to provide:</p>

          <li>Contacts, photos, or other personal files</li>
        </ul>

        <p>

          tracking for advertising purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Information That May Be Collected Automatically</h2>
        <p>
          When you use the iOS app, Apple and common mobile app services may automatically collect
          limited technical information to help the developer understand app performance and
          reliability. This may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Anonymous usage data, such as which screens are used and for how long</li>
          <li>Crash logs and error reports</li>
          <li>Basic device information (for example, device model and iOS version)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This information is used in aggregate form to improve the stability and usability of Big
          Improv Timer. It is not used to personally identify you.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Any diagnostic or usage information that is available is used solely to:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Identify and fix bugs or crashes</li>
          <li>Make design decisions to improve the app over time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

          Big Improv Timer does not sell your data. Limited information may be processed by platform
          providers (such as Apple) and analytics or crash-reporting tools, to the extent they are
          enabled for the app. These providers help deliver and improve the app.
        </p>

          does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
          You can stop all collection of app-related information by uninstalling the app from your
          device. You may also be able to control certain analytics or diagnostic settings in your
          iOS device settings under Privacy and Security.
