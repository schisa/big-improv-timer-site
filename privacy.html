        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Big Improv Timer handles information when you use our
          website and browser-based timer.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Big Improv Timer provides a browser-based timer and related informational pages at
          <strong>bigimprovtimer.xyz</strong> (the "Site") and
          <strong>timer.bigimprovtimer.xyz</strong> (the "Timer"). The service is designed to collect
          as little information as possible. There are no user accounts and no in-app social
          features.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Big Improv Timer does not ask you to intentionally provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your name</li>
          <li>Email address (except if you contact us directly)</li>
          <li>Phone number</li>
          <li>Contacts, photos, or other personal files</li>
          <li>Payment information</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The Site and Timer do not include ads and do not use third-party advertising trackers or
          advertising SDKs.
        </p>

        <h2>Information That May Be Collected Automatically</h2>
        <p>
          When you visit the Site or use the Timer, standard technical information may be collected
          automatically by your browser and our hosting providers. This may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>IP address and approximate location based on IP</li>
          <li>Browser type and version</li>
          <li>Device type and operating system</li>
          <li>Pages or URLs visited and basic usage events</li>
          <li>Referring URL (the page you came from)</li>
          <li>Date, time, and duration of your visit</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This information is typically stored in server logs and may be available in aggregated
          analytics from our hosting providers. It is used in aggregate form to keep the Site and
          Timer reliable and secure and to understand overall usage patterns. It is not used to
          personally identify you. We also use GoatCounter analytics (described below) to collect
          basic, anonymized analytics about site visits.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          Big Improv Timer does not use cookies or similar technologies for advertising or cross-site
          tracking. Our hosting providers may use limited cookies or similar technologies that are
          necessary to operate the service securely and reliably (for example, to route traffic or
          protect against abuse).
        </p>

        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We use GoatCounter, a privacy-friendly web analytics service, to understand how many people
          visit our Site and Timer and which pages are most viewed. GoatCounter:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does not use cookies</li>
          <li>Does not track you across websites</li>
          <li>Does not collect personal information</li>
          <li>
            Collects only basic visit information (pages viewed, referrer, browser type, screen size,
            and country based on IP address)
          </li>
          <li>Anonymizes your IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          GoatCounter is open source and designed to comply with privacy regulations including GDPR.
          You can learn more about GoatCounter&rsquo;s privacy practices at goatcounter.com/help/privacy.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Any technical or usage information that is available is used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Operate and secure the Site and Timer</li>
          <li>Understand basic, aggregated usage of the Timer</li>
          <li>Identify and fix issues or improve the experience over time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          Big Improv Timer does not sell your data. Limited information may be processed by third-party
          service providers that help run the Site and Timer (for example, hosting, DNS, analytics, or
          error logging providers). These providers process information only to operate and improve the
          service.
        </p>

        <h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Big Improv Timer is intended for general audiences and does not specifically target children.

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
          You can stop all collection of technical information related to your use by no longer using
          the Site or Timer. You may also be able to adjust privacy, cookie, and tracking controls in
          your web browser settings.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
